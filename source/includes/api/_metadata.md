# Metadata

## Metadata definition

A Metadata can be any kind of data associated to a existing resource (i.e. Dataset, Layer or Widget)

Some fields are important for identifying the entity properly, other ones are just optional and give extra information about it.

| Field             | Description                                                       | Type

### Finding By Ids

"ids" property is required in the payload, in other case the endpoint responds a 400 HTTP ERROR (Bad Request)
This property can be an Array or a String (comma-separated)
payload -> {"ids": ["112313", "111123"]}
payload -> {"ids": "112313, 111123"}

```shell
curl -X POST http://api.resourcewatch.org/dataset/metadata/find-by-ids \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d \
 '{
   "ids": [<ids>]
  }'
```

> Real example

```shell
curl -X POST http://api.resourcewatch.org/dataset/metadata/find-by-ids \
