# Metadata

## Metadata definition

A Metadata can be any kind of data associated to an existing resource (i.e. Dataset, Layer or Widget)

Some fields are important to identify the entity properly, others are just optional and give extra information about it.

| Field             | Description                                                       | Type

## Finding (getting) by ids

"ids" property is required in the payload, in other case the endpoint responds a 400 HTTP ERROR (Bad Request)
This property can be an Array or a String (comma-separated)
payload -> {"ids": ["112313", "111123"]}
payload -> {"ids": "112313, 111123"}

application filter:
```
application: gfw, gfw-climate, prep, rw, forest-atlas (select one or some of them)
```

language filter:
```
language: select between available languages (select one or some of them)
```

limit filter:
```
limit: the desired number
```

Custom param for /metadata endpoint
```
type: [dataset, widget, layer]

Prior to mid-century, the projected increase in air temperatures is about the same for all greenhouse gas scenarios, a result of the fact that a certain amount of warming is already “locked in” due to past emissions. After about 2050, projected warming depends on the amount of greenhouse gases emitted globally in the coming decades. For the 2050s (2040-2069, relative to 1970-1999), annual average air temperature is projected to rise +4.2°F to +5.9°F, on average, for a low (RCP 4.5) and a high (RCP 8.5) greenhouse gas scenario.
